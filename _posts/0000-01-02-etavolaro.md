Step 5: Commit a file
üéâ You created a branch!

Creating a branch allows you to make modifications to your project without changing the deployed master branch. Now that you have a branch, it‚Äôs time to create a file and make your first commit!

Commits 101
‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Your first commit
The following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub.

Create a new file on this branch, in a _posts folder called 0000-01-02-etavolaro.md. You can do so using this shortcut or manually as follows:
Return to the "Code" tab
In the branch drop-down, select "my-slide"
Click Create new file
In the "file name" field, type _posts/0000-01-02-etavolaro.md. Entering the / in the filename will automatically place your file in the _posts directory.
When you‚Äôre done naming the file, add the following content to your file:
---
layout: slide
title: "Welcome to our second slide!"
---
Your text
Use the left arrow to go back!
